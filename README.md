# fom-tools

Provide command line tools, and library functionality, that process High Level
Architecture (HLA) object models and object model modules:

- `fom check`: check a FOM for conformance against the Object Model Template
  standard and other style conventions (yet to be defined)
- `fom gen`: generate source code representing the FOM data for use when
  developing federates
- `fom merge`: merge a number of FOM Modules to create a FOM
