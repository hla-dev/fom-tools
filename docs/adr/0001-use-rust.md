# 1. Use Rust

Date: 2020-08-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want a real world project to spend more time with Rust. It is assumed that
Rust has the necessary XML parsing and writing libraries that will be required
for working with HLA OMT XML files.

## Decision

This project will be written in Rust.

## Consequences

We'll have a tool for merging, validating, and processing HLA FOM Modules.

This tool may be usable as part of a future RTI effort.

This tool may serve as the basis for a web based FOM tool.
